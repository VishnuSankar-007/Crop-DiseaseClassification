        <h1>Welcome to the Plant Disease Classifier</h1>
        <p>
    This website helps farmers and researchers identify plant diseases using AI.
    Simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and our model will predict the disease affecting it.
</p>

<p>
    Early detection of plant diseases can help reduce crop losses and improve agricultural productivity.
    Our AI-powered system is trained on a diverse dataset to recognize various plant diseases with high accuracy.
</p>

<p>
    This tool is especially useful for farmers, agricultural scientists, and students who want a quick and reliable way to
    diagnose plant health issues. Instead of relying on guesswork, users can get an AI-generated diagnosis within seconds.
</p>

<p>
    The model supports multiple crops, including tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, detecting diseases such as bacterial spots,
    early blight, and leaf mold. With this tool, farmers can take timely action to prevent the spread of infections.
